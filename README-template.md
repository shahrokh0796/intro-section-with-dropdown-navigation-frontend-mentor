## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vannila JavaScript


### What I learned

Since I completed an accessibility course for this project, I believe I have produced a product that is largely accessible to all user types. 

I would like to concentrate more on the strategies for bubbling and capturing events in JavaScript because I believe that this will help inÂ better performance, even though my project calls for a lot of events.

### Useful resources

-  https://web.dev/learn/accessibility - This assisted me in developing an accessible project. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
